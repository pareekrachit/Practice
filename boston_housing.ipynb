    "**Answer: \n",
    "1. As the number of rooms increases, area of house will also increase, thereby the median selling value of will also rise.\n",
    "2. As the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor) 'LSTAT' increases, the median     selling value of owner-occupied home prices will decrease. For example anyone will prefer a house in a neighbourhood which has social amenities like better schools, malls, restaurants, networking opportunities with better people and all these facilities will be available in a higher LSTAT area.\n",
    "3. 'PTRATIO' should be inversely proportional to the median house prices in that locality. This is if the 'PTRATIO' is less, then the kids at school will get more individual attention as a result the learning environment will be more efficient. Thereby people will be willing to buy a costlier home in the neighbourhood where the 'PTRATIO' is lower to give their kids a better learning opportunity."

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "* Choose one of the graphs above and state the maximum depth for the model. \n",
    "* What happens to the score of the training curve as more training points are added? What about the testing curve? \n",
    "* Would having more training points benefit the model? \n",
    "\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Top right graph has a Max_Depth =3. Training score is decreasing as we increase the number of training points, on other hand testing score is increasng as number of training points are increased. Initially when we have less number of training points so model memorizes the training data, so high training score and it fails on unseen data so less testing score. As number of data points are increased model starts generalizing better, so training score starts decreasing and testing score starts increasing. In general, more data means better generalizations hence better predcition on training data. For graph with depth = 3 shows that the training score and testing score have converged around n=300. So in this case adding more data points will not benefit the model."

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "For depth = 1 training score and testing score are nearly same which is due to high bias which is because model is too simple to capture trends in training data hince making large errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "On other hand, for depth = 10, training score is approximately equal to 1 and testing score is nearly equal to 0.7. It is evident from above scores that model is overfitting on training data and it tends to memorize data instead of learning characteristics of it, so it is not able to do welon tetsing data. This type of error is due to high variance.\n"

    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "By looking at the model complexity graph, we can see that the validation score is highest at depth = 4.\n",
    "Hence depth = 4 best generalizes the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "At depth = 1, training score and the validation score are both low, due to high bias and low variance. This means that the model is too simple to capture the trends in the trainng data hence underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we incerase depth, training score increases means model starts to fit the training data better. At the same time validation score also increases. Validataion score has it's xaximum out at depth = 4. This indicates that the depth of 4 is appripriate as a parameter of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we further increase the depth beyond 4 we will complicate the model, as we can see that training score curve is increasing but validation score curve starts decreases. At depth = 10, training score reaches its highest value but the validation score reaches its lowest indicating a high variance and low bias.\n",

    "* What is the k-fold cross-validation training technique? \n",

    "* What benefit does this technique provide for grid search when optimizing a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** When explaining the k-fold cross validation technique, be sure to touch upon what 'k' is, how the dataset is split into different parts for training and testing and the number of times it is run based on the 'k' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The K-fold cross validation technique is designed to serve two purposes, namely model selection and to obtain a conservative error estimation for the model.\n",
    "First we need to split our available data into two sets: the training set and the testing set. Next, K-fold cross validation splits the training data into k equal sub-buckets. Then model is then trained on (k - 1) subbuckets of training data, and remaining bucket are used to validate the model, i.e., to compute an error metric. We repeat this process k times, using all possible combinations of (k-1) sub-buckets and one bucket for validation. Next, we average out the error metric of all the k different trial runs on the model. The model with the lowest average error score is then selcted as the final model. Then, we evaluate the final model against the pre-withheld test data to obtain a conservative error estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a traditional train-test split, the error metric can have high variance, i.e., the error may depend heavily on which data points end up in the training set and which end up in the test set, and thus the evaluation may be significantly different depending on how the division is made. On the other hand for k-fold cross validation it matters less how the data gets divided. Every data point gets to be in a test set exactly once, and gets to be in a training set k-1 times. The variance of the resulting error estimate is reduced as k is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we need both Grid Search and K-Fold CV, because we not only need to utilize the data to select the best model but also need to determine which combination of meta-parameters of the chosen model would perform well. It is very important to select the model with K-fold CV and fine tune its meta-parameters with Grid-serach method."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
